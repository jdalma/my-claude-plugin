/**
 * `my-team remove-worker` — remove ONE worker from a running team mid-session.
 *
 * Exact inverse of add-worker, in reverse order: add-worker commits by
 * APPENDING to `manifest.workers` (the roster send-message enforces per call),
 * so remove commits by SPLICING it out. That single write is the transaction
 * point — once it lands, peers can no longer address the worker and the pane is
 * just a leftover process to kill.
 *
 * State (mailbox/archive/AGENTS.md, and any --worktree dir) is deliberately
 * left on disk: `shutdown` already backs the whole state_root up to `.bak`, and
 * worktree cleanup is the user's job (same rule add-worker documents).
