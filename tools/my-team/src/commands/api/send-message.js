/**
 * `my-team api send-message` — worker → worker mailbox.
 *
 * Input JSON:
 *   { team_name, from_worker, to_worker, body, reply_to?, expects_reply?, to_team? }
 *
 * `to_worker` must be a worker name in the team. The legacy
 * `leader-fixed` recipient is no longer supported: peer-to-peer model
 * (user observes each pane directly) means workers report to the user
 * via their pane stdout, not via a leader channel.
 *
 * ## Cross-team delivery (`to_team`)
 *
 * With `to_team` set, the recipient is looked up in ANOTHER running team,
 * addressed by its stable TEAM NAME (the manifest at
 * ~/.my-team/sessions/<team>/manifest.json is keyed by it). Omit it and the
 * recipient is resolved inside the sender's own team. The older `to_session`
 * (tmux session name) form is gone — never used in practice — and is rejected
 * so a stale prompt cannot fall through to a same-team send.
 *
 * Either way, tmux stays authoritative for LIVENESS: the recipient's pane is
 * resolved from tmux (via each pane's `@worker_name` option) against the
 * session recorded in the target manifest, so a dead team fails loudly
 * instead of spooling a message nobody will read. A manifest always points at
 * the NEWEST run of its team, which is exactly the run `to_team` should reach.
 *
 * ## Role guard (teams with orchestrator/worker roles)
 *
 * When manifests carry worker roles, this command enforces the routing rules
 * the AGENTS.md overlay describes:
 *   - role 'worker' senders may only message their own team's orchestrators,
 *     or reply (`reply_to` set) to any message they received; cross-team
 *     sends are rejected.
 *   - cross-team messages into a role-declaring team must address one of its
 *     orchestrators (the team's gateway).
 * Legacy manifests without roles are untouched — fully peer-symmetric.
